# Principal-component-analysis

## Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering Analysis

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), apply dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and conduct clustering analysis on both the original and PCA-transformed datasets. This includes comparing and analyzing the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering performance.

### Tasks and Workflow
### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
#### Feature Distribution:
- Examine the distribution of features using histograms, box plots, or density plots.
#### Feature Correlations:
- Investigate correlations between features to understand the relationships within the data.
  
### Task 2: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
#### Standardization:
- Standardize features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
#### PCA Implementation:
- Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
#### Optimal Components:
- Determine the optimal number of principal components using techniques such as scree plots or cumulative explained variance.
#### Data Transformation:
- Transform the original dataset into the principal components.

### Task 3: Clustering with Original Data
#### Clustering Algorithm:
- Apply a clustering algorithm, such as K-means,DBSCAN, Agglomorative to the original dataset.
#### Result Visualization:
- Visualize the clustering results using appropriate plots to show the distribution of clusters.
#### Performance Evaluation:
- Evaluate the clustering performance using metrics such as silhouette score or Daviesâ€“Bouldin index.

### Task 4: Clustering with PCA Data
#### Clustering on PCA Data:
- Apply the same clustering algorithm to the PCA-transformed dataset.
#### Result Visualization:
- Visualize the clustering results obtained from the PCA-transformed data.
#### Comparison:
- Compare the clustering results from the PCA-transformed data with those from the original dataset.

### Task 5: Comparison and Analysis
#### Result Comparison:
- Compare the clustering results between the original dataset and the PCA-transformed dataset.

### Discussion:
- Discuss any observed similarities or differences in the clustering results.
- Reflect on the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering performance.
- Analyze the trade-offs between using PCA and clustering directly on the original dataset.
